## Correlation: 
- Correlation evaluates the direction as well as strength of a relationship between continuous variables. 
- Correlation coefficient can range from -1 to +1, which signifies a strong negative to a strong positive relationship between the variables. Correlation=0, suggests that two variables are independent of each other. 
- A positive correlation points toward the positive relationship between two variables, which means if one variable changes the second variable also changes in the same direction(increase or decrease).
