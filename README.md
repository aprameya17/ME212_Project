 # ME212_Project
 
 # Description:

- India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. It has become the 3rd largest start-up ecosystem in the world after the US and China.
- In this project, I have performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Indian startup funding dataset for 2021. I have inferred some insights and tried to answer certain questions about the funding that occurred in 2021.

## Correlation: 
- Correlation evaluates the direction as well as strength of a relationship between continuous variables. 
- Correlation coefficient can range from -1 to +1, which signifies a strong negative to a strong positive relationship between the variables. Correlation=0, suggests that two variables are independent of each other. 
- A positive correlation points toward the positive relationship between two variables, which means if one variable changes the second variable also changes in the same direction(increase or decrease).
